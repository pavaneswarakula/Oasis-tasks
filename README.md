Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internships Tasks Submission

Dear Oasis Infobyte,

I'm pleased to present the Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks Submission Repository. This repository serves as a dedicated platform for me, the intern, to submit the tasks assigned by Oasis Infobyte for review and tracking. The tasks I'll be submitting include:

Unemployment Analysis with Python
Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
By utilizing this repository, I aim to streamline the task submission process and ensure timely and efficient communication with Oasis Infobyte. Thank you for providing this opportunity, and I look forward to contributing to the success of the internship program.

Best regards, PAVANESWAR AKULA
